<h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px;"><a href="./pdf/GenderGenerosityAERPP2013Final.pdf" target="blank">Selective Attribute Rules</a></h3>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Hans Haller)</p>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>Forthcoming, Journal of Economics</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(1)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_1"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_1" style="display:none;">: We develop an extension of Luce's (1959) model to apply multiattributes to stochastic choice. We consider an agent who focuses on selective (salient) attributes standing out in a choice set. These attributes are endogenously determined according to the criterion of Just Noticeable Difference. The criterion selects attributes whose variation impacts the agent enough so that she cares about each of them. When such selective attributes vary with the choice set, we adjust the choice probabilities for the elements of the choice set. We find that all the violations of Luce's axioms can be attributed to a change in selective attributes. When the global choice set is of the product form, selective attributes rules are characterized by an axiom named "SAR Consistency."

<h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px;"><a href="./pdf/MS18548manuscript.pdf" target="blank">Misleading Sales in Saliencen Markets</a></h3>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>Applied Economics Letters, January 2022</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(1)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_2"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_2" style="display:none;">: This paper studies misleading sales by the low-quality firm who competes against the high-quality firm. Misleading sales intentionally make consumers (mis-)believe that the current price is a limited-time discount price. It generates a decoy for the low-quality product that inflates the reference price in consumers' minds. We show that the low-quality firm can benefit by offering aggressive discount rates when consumers are salient thinkers who place a higher weight on a standing-out attribute.

<h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px;"><a href="./pdf/Learning%20in%20the%20Household.pdf" target="blank">Learning in the Household</a></h3>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with John Conlon, Malavika Mani, Matthew Ridley and Frank Schilbach)</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">Current Version: May 2021</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>Revise and Resubmit, Econometrica</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(11)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_11"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_11" style="display:none;">: We study social learning between spouses using an experiment in Chennai, India. We vary whether individuals discover information themselves or must instead learn what their spouse discovered via a discussion. Women treat their `own&#39; and their husband&#39;s information the same. In sharp contrast, men&#39;s beliefs respond less than half as much to information that was discovered by their wife. This is not due to a lack of communication: husbands put less weight on their wife&#39;s signals even when perfectly informed of them. In a second experiment, when paired with mixed- and same-gender strangers, \textit{both} men and women heavily discount their teammate&#39;s information relative to their own. We conclude that people have a  tendency to underweight others&#39; information relative to their own. The marital context creates a countervailing force for women, resulting in a gender difference in learning (only)  in the household.
