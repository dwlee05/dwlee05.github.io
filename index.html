<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(1)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_1"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_1" style="display:none;">: Why do people vote? We design a field experiment to estimate a model of voting `because others will ask&#39;. The expectation of being asked motivates turnout if individuals derive pride from telling others that they voted, or feel shame from admitting that they did not vote, provided that lying is costly. In a door-to-door survey about election turnout, we experimentally vary (i) the informational content and use of a flyer pre-announcing the survey, (ii) the duration and payment for the survey, and (iii) the incentives to lie about past voting. The experimental results indicate significant social image concerns. For the 2010 Congressional election, we estimate a value of voting ‘to tell others’ of about $15, contributing 2 percentage points to turnout. Lastly, we evaluate a get-out-the-vote intervention in which we tell potential voters that we will ask if they voted.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with John Conlon, Malavika Mani, Matthew Ridley and Frank Schilbach)</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">Current Version: May 2021</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>Revise and Resubmit, Econometrica</em></p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(11)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_11"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_11" style="display:none;">: We study social learning between spouses using an experiment in Chennai, India. We vary whether individuals discover information themselves or must instead learn what their spouse discovered via a discussion. Women treat their `own&#39; and their husband&#39;s information the same. In sharp contrast, men&#39;s beliefs respond less than half as much to information that was discovered by their wife. This is not due to a lack of communication: husbands put less weight on their wife&#39;s signals even when perfectly informed of them. In a second experiment, when paired with mixed- and same-gender strangers, \textit{both} men and women heavily discount their teammate&#39;s information relative to their own. We conclude that people have a  tendency to underweight others&#39; information relative to their own. The marital context creates a countervailing force for women, resulting in a gender difference in learning (only)  in the household.
